title: DRYER - Labex Ceba Annual project 2021
subtitle: 'Drought Resilience in seasonallY floodEd foRests'
Documentation: ceba
  
  The overall objective of DRYER is to unravel tree-microbiome interactions in response to predicted CC. We will investigate the vulnerability to drought of tree species strongly associated (specialist) or not (generalist) to SFF. Very few studies have cross-examined for SFF species multiple drought traits with the associated microbial community and tested whether the duration of drought periods could influence their resistance and resilience to future droughts. To address this question, we suggest a two-fold multidisciplinary approach which combines field sampling with greenhouse experiment. First, we will determine if the natural variability of mechanistic drought tolerance plant traits are linked to root microbiome of tree species co-occurring in SFF (specialist or generalist).

  # Filter toolbar (optional).
  # Add or remove as many filters (`filter_button` instances) as you like.
  # To show all items, set `tag` to "*".
  # To filter by a specific tag, set `tag` to an existing tag name.
  # To remove the toolbar, delete the entire `filter_button` block.
