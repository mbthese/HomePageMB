# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: My research focuses on tropical tree species’ functional traits and their spatial distribution across contrasted habitats in the context of climate change. I am also interested in the role microorganisms play in the plants' responses. During my post-doc, I will look more in depth at leaf and root trait coordination under drought, with a special interest for root hydraulics.

Hi, I'm Marion ! I'm a post doctoral researcher and my research focuses on tropical tree species’ functional traits and their spatial distribution across contrasted habitats in the context of climate change. I am also interested in the role microorganisms play in the plants' responses. During my post-doc, I will look more in depth at leaf and root trait coordination under drought, with a special interest for root hydraulics.
